        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <div class="hobbies">
           <p>Some hobbies of mine include video games, drumming, skating, and yo-yoing. My favorite games to play are Rocket League, Legend of Zelda, Valorant, and League of Legends. When it comes to drumming, I have been drumming since I was 7 years old. Whenever I have free time, I go out and skate with some friends. And yo-yoing may sound like a weird, niche hobby but it is true, I yo-yo. I got into competetive yo-yoing when I was 10 years old and got weirdly good at it. Now I find myself yo-yoing from time to time around my apartment.</p>
